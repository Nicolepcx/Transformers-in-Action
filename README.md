## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with `CH` followed by the chapter number. For example, CH03.
The notebooks are then organized as follows: `ch03_text_summarization_eval.ipynb`, where `ch03` indicates the chapter
and `text_summarization_eval` what is done in the notebook.
