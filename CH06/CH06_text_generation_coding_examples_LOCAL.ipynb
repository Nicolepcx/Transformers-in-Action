    "In this notebook, you will explore the different sampling methods and how they change the output of the model. You will also use the Falcon 7B model using various sampling strategies. This practical exercise will demonstrate how the choice of sampling method can significantly influence the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "I enchourage you to experiment with the different strategies! Try out how Greedy search, Beam search, Top-K sampling, and Top-p (nucleus) sampling changes the output. Observe how each strategy affects the style and content of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "As highlighted in the book, adjust the temperature setting to see its effect on the model's creativity. Notice how a temperature closer to 1 tends to produce more varied outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine also the differences in outputs between the methods. This will give you a deeper understanding of how each sampling technique guides the model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on exploration complements the theoretical knowledge from the book, giving you a tangible feel for the nuances of each sampling method with GPT 2 and Falcon 7B."

For decades the scientific community ignored the fact that those people actually interacted more intensely than animals — it became common to infer this from the fact these were also a group with similar features to ourselves. However, it now appears as though both the general perception of our species and interactions with ourselves may also offer some insight into the future of humans with AI, something which was never anticipated. Some new research, from researchers at the New York/Federation of U.S.-based AI Research & Development Systems (OCTAGA) indicates that brain cells respond selectively against various natural patterns of action of humans while a distinct neural signature comes from the action of our individual animals and those of others. This research is being conducted with animal systems developed exclusively by other researchers at Carnegie Institution for Biological Sciences and supported by Carnegie Corporation for Cancer Research.\n",

      "In a world where AI has become ubiquitous, many will feel better knowing it's part of their identity than feeling insecure that their personal values and intentions make a noticeable difference outside any form of government. The idea isn't lost cause. If a person becomes alienated from any institution by seeing it used wrong on the internet, that's fine, there are limits if it results from personal choice. By adopting such a system, it's becoming clear just how bad an act humans make. This isn't to suggest that everyone hates that idea or even its merits. Most online activities are not just a tool of violence and bigotry. However, human emotions are an important part of who we get together for. The ability and energy our minds generate are also valuable. In fact, some members of Congress (most important of them and often the ones who have power and money in it), also seem to see this as bad for business and personal relationships — even before the election did. In all seriousness, if a computer makes decisions which ultimately affects many of us more than life with our job, its influence in the public and the economy is immense, not only among us who live to work in the future, but many on America today.\n",
